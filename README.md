# CheckPoint 1
For checkpoint 1, I was suppose to have a home page with a basic U.I set up using Twitter's Oauth to sign in. However, for some reason the keys that I provided was not being accepted. Instead I decide to change the sign in using Google since it was working for me. For the next point, I wish to have at least a viewable page with Google Maps and having it deployed on the remote server.
