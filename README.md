# IST411SocialMaps

# Final Deliverable
I encountered many issues throughout my project. First being the Twitter keys not being accepted. Google Maps not displaying properly. Then one of the biggest challenges was trying to have tweets display along side Google Maps. Given the time that I had left, I eneded up changing a large aspect of my program to finish it. However, there is still room for improvement and change. Even though I did manage to get tweets based on geographic corrdinates, the overall look and feel to the UI could be A LOT better. 

Use Case 1: 
Set up basic login and authentication UI as well as basic home page UI *Completed

Use Case 2:
Communicate with Twiiter's API and get back information such as images, text, location(long, lat), etc... Format data using JSON or some form of of a mark up language. *Completed

Use Case 3:
Plot data and information onto Google Maps using the geolocation from Twitter's endpoints. Create visuals for the users on the Google Maps. Show hotspots from the data. *Partially Completed

Use Case 4:
Implement other social media APIs so that the end users are able to have access to more information. As well as implementing the APIs onto the maps. *Never completed

#What needs to be done...
TO-DO
Update and improve the UI so that the tweets could be displayed properly on Google Maps.
Update and improve code logic to communicate tweets and Google Maps API
Make it deployable
I want to continue working on this since it is a great learning experience.
