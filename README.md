# CheckPoint 2
At this point, I still have not resolved my issue with Twitter not accepting my keys. I switched to using Google's sign in API instead of using Twitter's OAuth login. I was able to display Google Maps onto the page. In terms of if I reached my goal for Checkpoint 2; I did not. I am still behind schedule for my project and at this point I have gotten maybe 1/3 to the checkpoint 2. Checkpoint 2 was to show that Google maps was able to plot points/pins and show tweets based on user searches OR moving the pin around on Google Maps. I need to continue to work on Twitter, otherwise  I will switch to a different social media site that works. 

Notes on project:
Hitting localhost:8080/  will show the google login logo

After login, it will redirect the user to the google maps

*Problem:* Can't get Twitter data unless I have the keys working. Will try Facebook API soon.

*Bug:* Using incognito is best since Chrome does not save credentials. Doing login a second time will automatically take you to maps.
