# CheckPoint 3
I resolved my Twitter key issues from checkpoint 2. I also updated my Google Maps
to have a search function as well as having an autocomplete function. When the user
types in a location, it will place a marker on the maps. In checkpoint 3, I wanted to
have the user enter a place and then display Tweets on the bottom of the page. 

#What needs to be done...
I still have trouble using Twitter's API since the documentation for it is in curl.
The good news is that I know that I can still use most of the methods that comes from
Spring Social. There is documentation on Spring's web page. What I hope to accomplish '
at this point is to allow users to enter a place, and on the bottom of the web page
displays the tweets. The bad news is that I was not able to complete the things I 
want. I was hoping to implement multiple social media APIs and gives the user to 
switch between different social medias on Google Maps. Kind of the reason why I changed
the name from Social Maps to Twitter Maps.
